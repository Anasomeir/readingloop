# Comparison operators and Evaluating conditions 

We can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: true or false.

- == mean is equal to “something “
- != is not equal to “something”
- === strict equal to “something “the exact data type.
- !== strict not equal to “something” the operator will check if it the same data type
- < less than something.
- >The data is greater than “something” 
- >= the data in greater than or equal to “something “
- < the data less than or equal to “something “
- && logical and to check all the data if its true so the result will be true.
- ! logical not if it true the operator will turn it false and so on. 

## Loop Counters

This instructs the code to run specified number of times and the code made up of three statements: 
- Initialization 
- Condition 
- Update 

Loops check a condition if the returns true a code block will run the n the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true the code will block will run again it repeats until the condition returns false.

## There are three common types of loops.

**For** if you need to run code a specific number of times.
**While** if you don’t know how many times the code should run.
